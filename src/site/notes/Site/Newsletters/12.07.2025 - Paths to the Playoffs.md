# Week 14 Newsletter: Paths to the Playoffs

Happy Sunday everyone! I know I've been very light on newsletters this year: it's been an unusually busy season for me, and I've barely been able to keep up with my leagues period, much less write newsletters for them. But it's a big week, so I'm pushing this one out!

I ran my Monte Carlo simulation on this week and simulated 100,000 Week 14 outcomes and their resulting playoff seedings. I stored all of those results in a database and told some powerful AI models to dig through the database and summarize all of the potential outcomes for me, because ain't nobody got time for that.

- Finishes 7-7
- Only makes it if absolute chaos occurs

### What [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] Needs When Winning:

**To guarantee playoffs (when finishing 8-6):**
- Already 94.2% likely to make it
- Only vulnerability: ALL of [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]], [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]], AND [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] also finish 8-6
  - Meaning [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] beats [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] (both finish 8-6)
  - Creates FIVE teams at 8-6 competing for 4 remaining spots
  - [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] can lose tiebreakers due to low points-for (1,645.82)

**Rooting interests for extra security:**
- 🎯 **[[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] to LOSE** vs [[Site/Teams/@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)\|@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)]] (happens 78.9% of time)
- **[[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] to LOSE** vs [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] (helps if Treg/Kathy both win)
- **[[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] to LOSE** vs [[Site/Teams/@Breesley (Squirtle Squad)\|@Breesley (Squirtle Squad)]]

If ANY of the three 7-6 threats lose, [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] is essentially locked in.

### Bottom Line:
**Beat [[Site/Teams/@Fun2025\|@Fun2025]] and you're 94% in.** The path is clear: win your game against a 1-12 team, and the odds heavily favor you making the playoffs.

---

## 3. [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] (7-6) - 86.7% Playoff Odds

**Week 14 Matchup:** vs **[[Site/Teams/@Breesley (Squirtle Squad)\|@Breesley (Squirtle Squad)]]** (5-8)

**Current Stats:**
- Record: 7-6
- Points For: 1,777.42 (3rd among 7-6 teams)
- League Median: 10-3
- P2P: 0.897

### Path to Playoffs:

**If [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] WINS (77.4% chance - favored):**
- ✅ **100% PLAYOFF ODDS** (clinches)
- Finishes 8-6
- Typical Seed: **#4** (84.7%) or **#5** (15.2%)
- Locks in a top-5 seed

**If [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] LOSES (22.6% chance):**
- ⚠️ **41.3% playoff odds** (toss-up)
- Finishes 7-7
- Typical Seed: **#6** (100% when making it)
- Needs median wildcard

### What [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] Needs When Losing:

**To secure #6 seed via median wildcard (41.3% chance):**

Looking at the 9,356 simulations where [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] loses but makes playoffs:
- ✅ [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] wins (98.2% frequency) - **CRITICAL**
- ✅ [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] wins (82.2% frequency) - Important
- ⚠️ [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] loses (64.6% frequency) - Helpful but not required

**Why [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] winning matters:**
- If [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] beats [[Site/Teams/@Fun2025\|@Fun2025]] → he takes a 4-5 seed at 8-6
- This leaves #6 (median wildcard) open for [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]]'s 10-3 LM record
- If [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] loses to [[Site/Teams/@Fun2025\|@Fun2025]] (extremely rare), [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]]'s 10-3 LM record crushes [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]]'s 6-7 LM record for the wildcard

**Nightmare scenario for [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]]:**
- [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] loses to [[Site/Teams/@Breesley (Squirtle Squad)\|@Breesley (Squirtle Squad)]] (22.6%)
- [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] upsets [[Site/Teams/@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)\|@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)]] (21.1%)
- Both [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] AND [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] also lose
- All three 7-7 teams compete for median wildcard

### Bottom Line:
**Control your destiny.** Beat [[Site/Teams/@Breesley (Squirtle Squad)\|@Breesley (Squirtle Squad)]] and you're in 100%. Lose and you need [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] to beat [[Site/Teams/@Fun2025\|@Fun2025]] (highly likely) to secure the median wildcard spot.

## 4. [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] (7-6) - 82.6% Playoff Odds

**Week 14 Matchup:** vs **[[Site/Teams/@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)\|@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)]]** (10-3)

**Current Stats:**
- Record: 7-6
- Points For: 1,792.26 (1st among 7-6 teams)
- League Median: 10-3
- P2P: 0.862

### Path to Playoffs:

**If [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] WINS (21.1% chance - underdog):**
- ✅ **100% PLAYOFF ODDS** (clinches)
- Finishes 8-6
- Typical Seed: **#4** (78.3%) or **#5** (21.3%)
- Pulls the upset and locks in top-5

**If [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] LOSES (78.9% chance - expected):**
- 📊 **77.9% playoff odds** (still likely)
- Finishes 7-7
- Typical Seed: **#6** (99.8% when making it)
- Relies on median wildcard (10-3 LM record)

### What [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] Needs When Losing:

**To secure #6 seed via median wildcard (77.9% chance):**

Looking at the 61,521 simulations where [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] loses but makes playoffs:
- Fairly resilient - makes it 77.9% of the time
- The 10-3 LM record is very strong
- [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] wins 99.0% of the time in these scenarios

**When [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] LOSES and MISSES playoffs (17,425 scenarios):**
The pattern in these 17,425 simulations where Treg loses and misses:
- ❌ [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] wins **100%** of the time (moves to 8-6, takes seed 4-5)
- ❌ [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] wins 69.4% of the time (moves to 8-6, takes seed 4-5)
- ❌ [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] wins 76.4% of the time (moves to 9-5, takes seed 3)
- ❌ [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] wins only 23.6% (surprising!)

**The pattern:** When all other contenders win their games, too many teams finish ahead of [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] at 7-7, even with a strong LM record. Note that in 100% of scenarios where Treg loses and misses, [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] has already won his game against [[Site/Teams/@Fun2025\|@Fun2025]]—meaning the #6 wildcard spot goes to either [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] or [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] (both also with 10-3 LM records) based on final scoring.

### What Helps [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]]:

**Best case scenarios when losing to [[Site/Teams/@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)\|@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)]]:**
1. 🎯 **[[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] LOSES** to [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] - Creates another 7-7 team competing for wildcard
2. **[[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] LOSES** to [[Site/Teams/@Breesley (Squirtle Squad)\|@Breesley (Squirtle Squad)]] - Same effect
3. **[[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] LOSES** to [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] - Prevents [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] from taking a top seed

When multiple 7-6 teams lose, [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]]'s 10-3 LM record shines as the best wildcard candidate.

### Bottom Line:
**Underdog with a safety net.** [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] faces the toughest opponent but has a strong 10-3 LM record as insurance. If the expected loss happens, they're still 78% to make playoffs via wildcard—but need to avoid the scenario where everyone else wins.

---

## 5. [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] (8-5) - 40.9% Playoff Odds

**Week 14 Matchup:** vs **[[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]]** (7-6)

**Current Stats:**
- Record: 8-5
- Points For: 1,526.20 (Lowest among contenders)
- League Median: 6-7
- P2P: 0.884

### Path to Playoffs:

**If [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] WINS (25.8% chance - underdog):**
- ✅ **100% PLAYOFF ODDS** (clinches)
- Finishes 9-5
- Guaranteed Seed: **#3** (100%)
- Locks in with 3rd-best record in league

**If [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] LOSES (74.2% chance - expected):**
- ⚠️ **20.3% playoff odds** (long shot)
- Finishes 8-6
- Typical Seed: **#5** (89.3%), **#6** (10.0%), or **#4** (0.7%)
- Needs help to sneak in

### What [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] Needs When Losing:

**To make playoffs at 8-6 (20.3% chance):**

Looking at the 15,055 simulations where [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] loses but makes playoffs:
- ✅ [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] wins 98.9% - **CRITICAL**
- ❌ [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] loses 89.0% - **CRITICAL**
- ❌ [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] loses 89.8% - **CRITICAL**

**The key pattern:**
When [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] loses to [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] (both finish 8-6), [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] needs:
1. Multiple other 7-6 teams to LOSE (creating 7-7 records)
2. [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] to WIN (takes seeds 4-5, clearing space)
3. [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] wins the median wildcard with their 6-7 LM record

**Why this is difficult:**
- [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] has the WEAKEST LM record (6-7) among 8-6 candidates
- If [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]], [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]], OR [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] also finish 8-6, they beat [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] on tiebreakers
- [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] needs BOTH [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] AND [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] to lose to have a realistic shot

**When [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] gets shut out:**
If [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]], [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]], AND [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] all finish 8-6:
- Spots 3-5: [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]], [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]], [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] (better PF/LM records)
- Spot 6: [[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] (better LM record would need verification, but higher playoff seed priority)
- [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]]: **ELIMINATED**

### What Helps [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]]:

**When losing to [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]], root for:**
1. 🎯 **[[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] to LOSE** to [[Site/Teams/@Breesley (Squirtle Squad)\|@Breesley (Squirtle Squad)]] (22.6% chance) - Huge
2. 🎯 **[[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] to LOSE** to [[Site/Teams/@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)\|@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)]] (78.9% chance) - Expected
3. ✅ **[[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]] to WIN** vs [[Site/Teams/@Fun2025\|@Fun2025]] (99.3% chance) - Nearly certain

If [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]] AND [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]] both lose, they finish 7-7 and [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] can grab the #6 seed at 8-6.

### Bottom Line:
**Win or bust.** [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]]'s 41% playoff odds are deceptive—they're really a 26% chance to upset [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] and clinch, or a 20% chance to back in with lots of help. The weak LM record and low points-for make them vulnerable to any other 8-6 team.

## Key Takeaways

### Most Secure Position:

### Most Straightforward Path:
**[[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]]** - Playing the worst team ([[Site/Teams/@Fun2025\|@Fun2025]]). Win rate is 99.3%, and winning gives 94% playoff odds. Just don't lose to a 1-12 team.

### Most Volatile:
**[[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]]** - All-or-nothing. Win and you're the #3 seed. Lose and you're fighting for scraps at 8-6 with a weak LM record.

### Control Your Destiny:
**[[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]], [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]], [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]], [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]]** - Any of these teams winning clinches 100%.

**[[Site/Teams/@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)\|@CalebD (Blue Jeanty)]]** - Winning gets to 94% (close enough to clinched).

### What [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] Needs When Losing:

**To secure #5 seed at 7-7 (98.6% chance):**

When [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] loses to [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] (both finish at their final records), Brian almost always takes the #5 seed because:
- Finishes 7-7 vs the 6-7 teams ([[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]], [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]])
- Better record wins the tiebreaker
- Only misses in the extremely rare scenario (1.4%) where simulation variance creates unexpected results

**The 1.4% miss scenarios:**
These are statistical outliers where unusual playoff seeding occurs. For practical purposes, Brian is locked in.


> [!NOTE] AI is confused?
> 
> Lol, the AI seems to be unable to parse why you miss in 1.4% of scenarios, and I don't have time to dig into what those scenarios might be. Would be hilarious if it happened, though.

### Bottom Line:
**Virtual lock for playoffs.** [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] has a 76.9% chance to win and clinch outright, and even with a loss, the 7-7 record beats all 6-7 teams for the #5 seed 98.6% of the time. This is as close to guaranteed as it gets without officially clinching.

## 2. [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] (6-7) - 42.1% Playoff Odds

**Week 14 Matchup:** vs **[[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]]** (6-6, already clinched)

**Current Stats:**
- Record: 6-7
- Points For: 1,552.60
- League Median: 6-7
- P2P: 0.867

### Path to Playoffs:

**If [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] WINS (23.7% chance - underdog):**
- 📊 **72.7% PLAYOFF ODDS** (likely in)
- Finishes 7-7
- Guaranteed Seed: **#5** (100% when making playoffs)
- Needs [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] to beat [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]]

**If [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] LOSES (76.3% chance - expected):**
- ⚠️ **32.6% PLAYOFF ODDS** (underdog)
- Finishes 6-8
- Guaranteed Seed: **#6** (100%) when making it
- Competes with [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] for #6 seed via median wildcard

### What [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] Needs When Winning:

**To secure #5 seed at 7-7 (72.7% chance):**

Looking at the 17,231 simulations where [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] wins and makes playoffs:
- ✅ [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] beats [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] **100%** of the time ← **CRITICAL**
- [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]]'s result doesn't matter (wins 42.5%, loses 57.5%)

**Why [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] winning matters:**
- If Brian wins: Brian 8-6 (#4), [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] 7-7 (#5), [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] 7-7 (out)
- If Lori wins: Lori 8-6 (#4), Brian 7-7 (#5), [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] 7-7 (#6 or out)
  - At 7-7, [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] competes with Brian
  - Brian's higher PF (1,650) beats [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] (1,553)
  - [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] typically loses tiebreaker

**The critical dependency:**
[[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] winning only helps if [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] also wins. The expected outcome (76.9%) aligns with this, giving [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] 72.7% playoff odds when winning.

### What [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] Needs When Losing:

**To secure #6 seed at 6-8 (32.6% chance):**

Looking at the 24,887 simulations where [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] loses but makes playoffs:
- ✅ [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] wins 99.3% of the time (creates 8-6 vs 7-7 vs 6-8 tiers)
- ❌ [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] loses 78.1% of the time (keeps him at 6-8)

**The key pattern:**
When both [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] and [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] finish 6-8, they compete for the #6 seed (median wildcard). [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]]'s higher points-for (1,553 vs 1,496) and similar LM record (6-7 for both) gives [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] the edge in many scenarios.

**The nightmare scenario:**
- [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] loses to [[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]] (76.3%)
- [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] beats [[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]] (44.1%)
- [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] finishes 7-7, [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] finishes 6-8
- Better record wins → [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] takes #6 seed

### What Helps [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]]:

**When winning (upset [[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]]):**
- 🎯 **[[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] to WIN** vs [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] (76.9% likely) ← **CRITICAL**

**When losing (expected outcome):**
- 🎯 **[[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] to LOSE** vs [[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]] (55.9% likely) ← Important
- ✅ **[[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] to WIN** vs [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] (76.9% likely) ← Expected

### Bottom Line:
**Underdog with a path.** [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]]'s 42.1% playoff odds come from two scenarios: (1) upset [[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]] AND Brian beats Lori (72.7% × 23.7% = 17.2% contribution), or (2) lose to [[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]] but win the 6-8 tiebreaker vs [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] (32.6% × 76.3% = 24.9% contribution). The second path is more likely but requires [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] to also lose.

---

## 3. [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] (6-7) - 31.3% Playoff Odds

**Week 14 Matchup:** vs **[[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]]** (8-4, already clinched)

**Current Stats:**
- Record: 6-7
- Points For: 1,495.62 (Lowest among contenders)
- League Median: 6-7
- P2P: 0.870

### Path to Playoffs:

**If [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] WINS (44.1% chance - slight underdog):**
- ⚠️ **45.7% PLAYOFF ODDS** (toss-up)
- Finishes 7-7
- Guaranteed Seed: **#6** (99.9% when making playoffs)
- Needs help to secure the spot

**If [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] LOSES (55.9% chance - slight favorite to lose):**
- ⚠️ **19.9% PLAYOFF ODDS** (long shot)
- Finishes 6-8
- Guaranteed Seed: **#6** (100%) when making it
- Competes with [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] for #6 seed via median wildcard

### What [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] Needs When Winning:

**To secure #6 seed at 7-7 (45.7% chance):**

Looking at the 20,152 simulations where [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] wins and makes playoffs:
- ✅ [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] wins 99.4% of the time ← **CRITICAL**
- ✅ [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] loses 99.7% of the time ← **CRITICAL**

**The key pattern:**
When [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] finishes 7-7, the playoff picture typically looks like:
- Seed 4: [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] (8-6) OR [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] (8-6)
- Seed 5: The other 7-7 team
- Seed 6: [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] (7-7) via median wildcard

But this ONLY works if:
1. [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] beats [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] (so one team is 8-6, one is 7-7)
2. [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] loses to [[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]] (so [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] is 6-8, not competing for 7-7 spot)

**Why [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] loses half the time even when winning:**
If [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] ALSO wins (23.7% chance), then:
- Brian 8-6 (#4), [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] 7-7 (#5), [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] 7-7 (#6 or out)
- [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] has better PF (1,553 vs 1,496) and similar LM record
- [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] wins tiebreaker, [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] misses

### What [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] Needs When Losing:

**To secure #6 seed at 6-8 (19.9% chance):**

Looking at the 11,126 simulations where [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] loses but makes playoffs:
- ✅ [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] wins 99.0% of the time
- ❌ [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] loses 100% of the time ← **CRITICAL**

**The key pattern:**
When both [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] and [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] finish 6-8, they compete for the #6 seed. [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]]'s higher points-for (1,553 vs 1,496) typically wins the tiebreaker despite similar LM records (both 6-7). When both lose, [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] makes it 32.6% of the time vs [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]]'s 19.9%.

### What Helps [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]]:

**When winning (upset [[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]]):**
- 🎯 **[[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] to WIN** vs [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] (76.9% likely) ← **CRITICAL**
- 🎯 **[[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] to LOSE** vs [[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]] (76.3% likely) ← **CRITICAL**

If both happen (58.7% combined), [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] gets the #6 seed at 7-7.

**When losing (expected outcome):**
- 🎯 **[[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] to LOSE** vs [[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]] (76.3% likely) ← **CRITICAL**
- ✅ **[[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] to WIN** vs [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] (76.9% likely) ← Expected

Even with both, only makes it 19.9% due to weak tiebreaker stats (lowest PF among contenders).

### Bottom Line:
**Long shot with two paths.** [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] has a 44.1% chance to upset [[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]], but that only gives 45.7% playoff odds because he needs BOTH Brian to win AND [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] to lose. The more likely scenario (losing to [[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]]) gives only 19.9% playoff odds because [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] typically wins the 6-8 tiebreaker with higher points-for.

---

## 4. [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] (7-6) - 26.9% Playoff Odds

**Week 14 Matchup:** vs **[[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]]** (7-6)

**Current Stats:**
- Record: 7-6
- Points For: 1,542.24 (Lowest among 7-6 teams)
- League Median: 5-8 (Weakest among contenders)
- P2P: 0.878

### Path to Playoffs:

**If [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] WINS (23.1% chance - underdog):**
- ✅ **100% PLAYOFF ODDS** (clinches)
- Finishes 8-6
- Guaranteed Seed: **#4** (100%)
- Pulls the upset and locks in 4th seed

**If [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] LOSES (76.9% chance - expected):**
- ⚠️ **5.0% PLAYOFF ODDS** (nearly eliminated)
- Finishes 7-7
- Typical Seed: **#6** (74.4%) or **#7** (92.0% misses playoffs) when at 7-7
- Needs significant help to survive

### What [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] Needs When Losing:

**To secure a playoff spot at 7-7 (5.0% chance):**

Looking at the 3,831 simulations where [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] loses but still makes playoffs:
- ❌ [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] loses 75.8% of the time (must finish 6-8)
- ❌ [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] loses 70.6% of the time (must finish 6-8)

**The pattern:**
[[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] needs BOTH [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] and [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] to lose their games. But even then, she only makes it 5.0% of the time due to:
- Weak 5-8 league median record (worst among all contenders)
- Lowest points-for among 7-6 teams (1,542.24)
- Loses tiebreakers to teams with better LM records or higher PF

**Why it's so difficult:**
Even at 7-7, [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]]'s weak LM record makes her vulnerable in wildcard scenarios. When both [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] and [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] finish 6-8, one of them typically wins the #6 seed over [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] due to the league median wildcard tiebreaker favoring teams closer to .500.

### What Helps [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]]:

**Best case scenarios when losing to [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]]:**
1. 🎯 **[[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] LOSES** to [[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]] (76.3% likely) ← Expected
2. 🎯 **[[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] LOSES** to [[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]] (55.9% likely) ← Slightly favored
3. Need extremely favorable scoring to win #6 seed over the 6-8 teams

Even with both opponents losing, [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] faces long odds due to poor tiebreakers.

### Bottom Line:
**Win or bust.** [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]]'s playoff hopes rest almost entirely on upsetting [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] (23.1% chance). If she loses the head-to-head, even with help, her weak LM record and low PF make the #6 seed nearly impossible to capture at 7-7.

## The Bottom Line

**Almost Certain:**
- [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] makes playoffs (99.7%)

**Likely but Not Guaranteed:**
- One of {[[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]], [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]], [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]]} makes playoffs as #6 seed

**The Pecking Order for #6:**
1. **[[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] at 8-6** (23.1% to get here, 100% playoff if achieved)
2. **[[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] at 7-7** (23.7% to get here, ~73% playoff if achieved)
3. **[[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] at 7-7** (44.1% to get here, ~46% playoff if achieved)
4. **[[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] at 6-8** (76.3% to get here, ~33% playoff if achieved)
5. **[[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] at 6-8** (55.9% to get here, ~20% playoff if achieved)
6. **[[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] at 7-7** (76.9% to get here, ~5% playoff if achieved)

**The Expected Outcome (32.9% of simulations):**
- Brian beats Lori (76.9%)
- [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] loses to [[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]] (76.3%)
- [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] loses to [[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]] (55.9%)
- **Combined probability: 32.9%**

**Result:** Brian #4 (8-6), Lori misses (7-7), both [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] and [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] finish 6-8, [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] wins #6 seed ~33% of the time
