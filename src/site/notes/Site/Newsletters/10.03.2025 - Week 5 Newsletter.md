# 2025 Week 5 Newsletter

> [!warning] BYE Weeks Are Upon Us!
> 
> Fix your lineups! In my dynasty league I manually fix lineups to make sure everyone's fielding a legal starting lineup, and if I do it more than once the team suffers penalties to their draft position the following year. Best weapon I have in this league is shame, so I *will* shame you if I have to do it.

Well, September went by quick. üòÖ Been a busy past month for me, so I've not gotten around to writing a newsletter until now. Part of it is that my tools and special spreadsheet I've been using to analyze stats and make the tables I put in the newsletters got a bit buggy after some changes to Sleeper's API.

However, I've spent some time working on scripts to automate everything and even expand on the stats and tables I've put in these newsletters, meaning newsletters should take less time and I'll be able to write more of them!
# The Wall of Nameless Shame

The following teams have not updated their team names in Sleeper, and thus are named `Team {USERNAME}`. Boo these teams. Boo them!

- [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025\|@Treg2025]]
- [[Site/Teams/@Fun2025\|@Fun2025]]
- [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]]
- [[Site/Teams/@kcorrigan81\|@kcorrigan81]]
- [[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]]
- [[Site/Teams/@mechanicmike\|@mechanicmike]]

I care more about team names now that we have the perpetual trophy, and I reserve the right to insult you on the silver nameplate that goes on the trophy if you win it all without setting a team name.

Alright, shame out of the way‚Äìlet's get into the **power rankings**!

# Week 5 Power Rankings

If you were in the PVFFL last year (and I think the year prior), you'll be familiar with this. I use a pretty simple method to derive a more-or-less objective power ranking. It's based on your [[Site/Glossary/Absolute Wins\|Absolute Wins]] each week.

> [!info] Absolute Wins
> 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/glossary/absolute-wins/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">




This is the number of wins you would have for a given time period (e.g. a week) if you played every other team in the league (or in some cases, multiple leagues).

So, for example, if you were the top scorer in a 10-team league for a given week, that would give you 9 absolute wins for that week, since you would have beaten every one of the other teams. 

</div></div>


For my power ranking calculation, generally, more absolute wins across the season = higher power ranking. There's one wrinkle, though: more recent weeks are weighted more heavily. The further we go along in the season, the less your early boom performances contribute to your power score. Consistency is key.

## Power Rank Across Both Leagues

This table compares all teams across both leagues *against* each other. While your power relative to someone in the opposite league doesn't matter for playoff purposes, at the end of it all you will be directly competing with the best team from the opposite league for the <mark class="yellow">Grand Champion</mark> title, so it does still matter!

[[Site/Teams/@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)\|@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)]]'s fall from 1st to 5th demonstrates the importance of consistency (and recency) to these power rankings. For the first three weeks, he was a juggernaut, and then he stumbled a bit and scored in the bottom 6 across both leagues. Here are the top-5 teams by raw absolute wins (unweighted):

[[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]] is having an incredible start to the season, having (technically) not lost a game (ignore the tie) and being one of only two teams across both leagues with an undefeated record against the [[Site/Misc/PVFFL League Constitution#Section 3 ‚Äì The League Median\|League Median]] (the other team being [[Site/Teams/@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)\|@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)]]).

The biggest surprise here is [[Site/Teams/@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)\|@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)]]'s dominance to start the season. [[Site/Teams/@BenH üèÜ (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH üèÜ (Marshmallow Fluff)]] made a lot of noise around draft time that he tried his best to nudge Mini Mallow to make better draft decisions for Olivia's sake, but clearly he should have trusted the process.

A number of reversals here as well: [[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]] and [[Site/Teams/@blamie\|@blamie]] were both graded highly by experts but have had a middling start to the season. Neither of them have named their teams, so they honestly probably deserve it. 
[[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]]'s team has also disappointed slightly after being graded highest after the draft, but his odds of a playoff berth are still decent, especially given his easy strength of schedule rest of season (keep reading for details).

Meanwhile, [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]] got a fairly low grade in the preseason, but he's been pretty excellent through four weeks.

- [[Site/Teams/@BenH üèÜ (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH üèÜ (Marshmallow Fluff)]] has the second-worst luck in the league, so all is right with the world.
- [[Site/Teams/@Breesley (Squirtle Squad)\|@Breesley (Squirtle Squad)]] stole [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]]'s luck: Breesley should be down a win, and Kathy should be up one. Fortunately for Kathy (and unfortunately for [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] and me), that's why the wild card sixth seed (based on [[Site/Misc/PVFFL League Constitution#Section 1 ‚Äì Seeding for 10- and 12-team Leagues\|league median record]]) exists. Despite being 8th in the current standings, Kathy would get into the playoffs if they were seed today:

Fun fact: [[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]] has been an underdog in each of her four games this season (according to Sleeper's projections). She received a decent draft grade in the preseason, but she's demonstrated the strength of her roster (namely Puka Nacua, arguably the best value WR from the draft given his ADP). She has the strongest WR corps in the league, which helps to make up for her somewhat lacking RB and QB situation.

The question will be whether [[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]] will continue her streak of dominance as we enter BYE weeks or whether her team will start to regress to the mean. If the latter, will it even matter? Her strength of schedule for the rest of the season should be relatively easy based on past performance, and at 3-0-1, she can drop some games and still make it to the playoffs. We'll just have to wait and see.

She's favored in her matchup this week for the first time this season, but her opponent is the #2 ranked [[Site/Teams/@MarkH (Shake and Bake)\|@MarkH (Shake and Bake)]]. We'll see if he can deliver her first loss and maybe take the #1 spot; my money's on [[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]][^1].

[^1]: For the record, I wrote this before Puka went nuts again on TNF.

That's it! Glad I could get a newsletter in, finally. Good luck this week!
