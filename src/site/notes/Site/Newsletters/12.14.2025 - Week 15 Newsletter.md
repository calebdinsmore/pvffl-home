# Week 15 Newsletter: Playoffs are Set

Well, that was a pretty tense MNF game for the North league. Everything came down to the second-to-last play of overtime: if Dallas Goedert didn't catch that pass, I would have made it into the playoffs and [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] would have been locked out. Crazy week!

> Moment of shame for [[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]], the only playoff-bound team who hasn't set a proper team name.
# The Playoff Picture

## PVFFL North: The Wildcard Seed Comes Through Again

![Pasted image 20251209161437.png](/img/user/z_Assets/Pasted%20image%2020251209161437.png)

For the second season in a row, [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] has made it into the playoffs with a 7-7 record thanks to the wildcard seed, which I added to this league in large part because of how insanely unlucky he seems to be year after year. So the seed is doing its job, at least. 

He's the reigning champ, but he hasn't put up a winning regular season in the past four seasons, even in a season where he's scored the most points! Truly elite bad luck: I can't wait to see what this does to his all-time luck stat at the end of the season!

## North Matchups

### [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] vs. [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]]

![Pasted image 20251213234320.png](/img/user/z_Assets/Pasted%20image%2020251213234320.png)

Week 14 rematch! These teams faced each other just last week, with [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]] upsetting the reigning champs to punch their ticket to the playoffs. Can they pull it off for the second week in a row to make it to the semifinals?

Because I love Monte Carlo simulations, I ran 100,000 simulations of the playoffs, and here's how these teams stacked up:

**[[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]]'s playoff prospects:**

| Outcome | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| **Championship Winner** | 17.9% |
| Runner-up (Finals Loss) | 12.1% |
| Reach Finals | 30.0% |
| Reach Semifinals | 61.4% |

**[[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]]'s playoff prospects:**

| Outcome                 | Probability |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| **Championship Winner** | 7.2%        |
| Runner-up (Finals Loss) | 7.6%        |
| Reach Finals            | 14.8%       |
| Reach Semifinals        | 38.6%       |

It'll be an uphill battle for [[Site/Teams/@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)\|@kPaterso (PatricksPunters)]]: even though Ben has the worst luck in PVFFL history, he was a force to be reckoned with last postseason. That said, his roster's a bit thin at this point, and anything could happen.

If Ben wins this week, he gets to have another rematch, this time with [[Site/Teams/@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)\|@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)]], whom he narrowly defeated in last year's championship.

### [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025 (Team Treg)\|@Treg2025 (Team Treg)]] vs [[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]]

![Pasted image 20251213235455.png](/img/user/z_Assets/Pasted%20image%2020251213235455.png)

Quite fun that both pairs of married couples in the North league made it to the playoffs. Unfortunately we won't get a husband vs. wife championship this year with how the brackets shook out, but regular marital playoff games are still fun.

Both teams are pretty evenly projected going into Sunday, with Kathy getting a slight edge. The Monte Carlo results for this week are also quite close:

**[[Site/Teams/@Treg2025 (Team Treg)\|@Treg2025 (Team Treg)]]'s playoff prospects:**

| Outcome | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| **Championship Winner** | 14.5% |
| Runner-up (Finals Loss) | 17.3% |
| Reach Finals | 31.8% |
| Reach Semifinals | 58.0% |

**[[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]]'s playoff prospects:**

| Outcome | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| **Championship Winner** | 7.4% |
| Runner-up (Finals Loss) | 12.2% |
| Reach Finals | 19.6% |
| Reach Semifinals | 42.0% |

[[Site/Teams/@Treg2025 (Team Treg)\|@Treg2025 (Team Treg)]] is slightly favored by the simulations, which are of course far from perfect. I think I'm personally rooting for Craig in this one: his teams are consistently good (hasn't put up a losing record and has made it to the playoffs in 3 of the past 4 seasons), but he hasn't yet managed to take home a trophy since I took over commissioning this league. 
Good luck, Craig!

## PVFFL South: Lori Sneaks in for a Shot at Title #2

![Pasted image 20251214114544.png](/img/user/z_Assets/Pasted%20image%2020251214114544.png)

![Screenshot 2025-12-14 at 11.46.43 AM.png](/img/user/z_Assets/Screenshot%202025-12-14%20at%2011.46.43%20AM.png)

It was do-or-die for [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] last week, and she managed to upset [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] to lock in a spot in the playoffs and keep the dream alive for back-to-back championships (and perhaps a first-time Grand Championship title).

That win also kept Lori's streak of winning seasons alive, having consistently put up winning seasons in each of the last four seasons. As far as consistency goes, Lori stands alone, being the only team to make a playoff appearance four times in four years. 👏

## Matchups

### [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]] vs [[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]]

![Pasted image 20251214115731.png](/img/user/z_Assets/Pasted%20image%2020251214115731.png)

Projections are looking tough for [[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]] going into Sunday after some strong performances by Bijan Robinson and Chase McLaughlin (and a weak performance by Bucky Irving). Of course, these projections will fluctuate wildly over the course of the day, so anything is possible here.

**[[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]]'s playoff prospects:**

| Outcome | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| **Championship Winner** | 0.7% |
| Runner-up (Finals Loss) | 5.2% |
| Reach Finals | 5.9% |
| Reach Semifinals | 38.5% |

**[[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]]'s playoff prospects:**

| Outcome | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| **Championship Winner** | 31.7% |
| Runner-up (Finals Loss) | 13.9% |
| Reach Finals | 45.6% |
| Reach Semifinals | 78.9% |

[[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]] is one of the three favorites to win it all in the league (along with [[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]] and [[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]] who are on BYE), and the majority of simulations have her winning this week with ease. Exceptional performances on Lori's side might just defy those odds, though.

If [[Site/Teams/@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)\|@trustyen (Won't you be my nabers)]] pulls out the win this week, she goes on to face [[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]], ensuring that one of them (the only married couple to both make it to the postseason in this league) gets into the finals.

I personally hope whoever wins this defeats [[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]] next week, since he's the only playoff team who hasn't set their team name. **SHAME**
### [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] vs [[Site/Teams/@kcorrigan81 (Gator-ade)\|@kcorrigan81 (Gator-ade)]]

![Pasted image 20251214121132.png](/img/user/z_Assets/Pasted%20image%2020251214121132.png)

This is looking to be a close match, after another lackluster performance from Emeka Egbuka on TNF. [[Site/Teams/@kcorrigan81 (Gator-ade)\|@kcorrigan81 (Gator-ade)]] is currently favored by Sleeper's projections, but the Monte Carlo simulations have [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]] pulling out the win the majority of the time. Brian really needs Jalen Hurts to not have another Week 14 if he wants to get the win here.

**[[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]]'s playoff prospects:**

| Outcome | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| **Championship Winner** | 2.6% |
| Runner-up (Finals Loss) | 12.0% |
| Reach Finals | 14.5% |
| Reach Semifinals | 61.5% |

**[[Site/Teams/@kcorrigan81 (Gator-ade)\|@kcorrigan81 (Gator-ade)]]'s playoff prospects:**

| Outcome | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| **Championship Winner** | 2.3% |
| Runner-up (Finals Loss) | 3.4% |
| Reach Finals | 5.7% |
| Reach Semifinals | 21.1% |

Both teams are long shots to win it all according to my iron-clad Monte Carlo simulations that are never wildly off base. 🙂‍↕️

That's all for this week! Excited to see how this year's playoffs play out, even if I have to be an outside observer this time.

Good luck everyone!
