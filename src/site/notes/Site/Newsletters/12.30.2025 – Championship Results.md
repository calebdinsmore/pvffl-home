# Here's to the Victors 🏆

Man, what a game to end the fantasy season on. Leave it to Atlanta to dominate early and then give up their entire massive lead in the second half. \#28-3

# Our New Grand Champion

It ended up being incredibly close between the leaders in the two leagues. 

In the North league, given Puka Nacua's relatively middling performance last night, [[Site/Teams/@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)\|@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)]] didn't even break 140 points, ending up at 138.78.

His opponent [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] on the other hand was hard carried by an absolutely crazy performance by Bijan Robinson, featuring the longest play of the season so far–a 93-yard run for a touchdown. His other player, Drake London, somewhat predictably was a complete non-factor in the game, scoring only 0.9 points to Bijan's **37.40**. 
With that, [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] handily defeated [[Site/Teams/@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)\|@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)]] **159.34 to 138.78**.

In the South league, [[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]] was leaning on Kyren Williams to carry him to Grand Championship glory (having already securely locked up the South league championship). To do so, given Ben's final score of 159.34, he needed Kyren to score at least 18.64 points. High but certainly not unheard of.
Unfortunately, Kyren only put up **14.50** points, and [[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]] fell short of beating [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] by a mere **4.15** points. In the last scoring drive for the Rams, if Kyren had managed to get into the endzone instead of Puka, we'd be looking at a new Grand Champion. Ben needed almost every last point he got from Bijan.

And so...

## Congratulations, Back-to-Back Grand Champion [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]]!

##### and PVFFL South Champion [[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]] 🥳

Your trophies are being manufactured in the lab–or rather, they will be. I'm making small tweaks to the design to make them easier to make/require less manual assembly.

*Last year's trophies*

If you didn't know, league champions get to keep a certified Caleb Dinsmore Original™ trophy I've dubbed the Golden Pulpit. It's modeled after our very own pulpit and stands around six inches tall. Display it with pride, throw it away, whatever–it's your pulpit.

And of course, [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] gets his and his team's names once again immortalized on the ridiculously large championship trophy. One benefit to Ben winning again was that Chrome's autofill saved me some keystrokes ordering the nameplate.

### Okay I need to talk about something real quick

[[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] winning it all for the second season in a row is pretty crazy. Winning it for the second season in a row after going 7-7 in the regular season is really crazy. Winning it for the second season in a row *because* he went 7-7 in the regular season is actual insanity. Let me explain.

In Week 14, Ben was almost certain to make it into the playoffs, win or lose. There was a very small chance he didn't (which almost happened), but given how favored he was in the last matchup and how strong his League Median record was, he was pretty much a shoo-in.
But his team collapsed, and he put up his worst score of the season. Rather than secure the 3rd seed, he fell to the 6th.

Ultimately, this seeding proved to be crucial: if he had won and gotten the 3rd seed, he would have lost to *any other opponent* he would have possibly had and been knocked out in the first round.

Last season, **almost this exact playoff scenario played out.** He went 7-7, got matched up against the 3rd seed ([[Site/Teams/@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)\|@Kathy8 (In a world of Hurts)]]) and barely eked out a win by **just 0.24 points.** Thing is, he and his opponent were the lowest scoring teams in the playoffs that round. If Ben had seeded higher, he would have lost to either [[Site/Teams/@Treg2025 (Team Treg)\|@Treg2025 (Team Treg)]] or [[Site/Teams/@BrianH (SMACKdown!)\|@BrianH (SMACKdown!)]].

Also fun tidbit: [[Site/Teams/@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)\|@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)]] and [[Site/Teams/@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)\|@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)]] both also had first-round BYEs in last season's playoffs in the same league. Lots of weird parallels these past two seasons.

Or maybe there are some numerology shenanigans going on, and Ben's cracked the secret to a blessed postseason:

*Lot of sevens you got there, Ben.*

Anyway, I just needed to get that off my chest. Wild season.

Well, that's a wrap. I might send out one more of these with fun stats/awards after I compile everything and update team stats and whatnot, but in case I don't, thanks everyone for playing! I love commissioning this league and hope I make it a fun time.

Hope everyone had a great Christmas, and happy New Year!
