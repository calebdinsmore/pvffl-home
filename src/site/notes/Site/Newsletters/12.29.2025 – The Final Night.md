# The Final Night of the 2025 Season

Well, here we are, at the cusp of the end of the season, and (almost) nothing is set in stone.

# The Battle for Grand Champion

At this point, three out of the four competing team are still very much alive and in contention: [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]], [[Site/Teams/@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)\|@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)]], and [[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]]. Barring an absolutely insane night for Matt Stafford and Puka Nacua, [[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]] is effectively out of the running at this point. Here are the matchups as they stand going into Monday night:

By Sleeper's projections, [[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]] is winning the race for Grand Champ by a mere **0.77** points, with [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] just barely behind. [[Site/Teams/@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)\|@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)]] is only **7.07** points behind Ben, a larger but still relatively small difference.

Each team is looking for different players to perform tonight.
[[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]]'s yet-to-play:
- Bijan Robinson (RB) - ATL
	- Projected: 17.91 points
- Drake London (WR) - ATL
	- Projected: 13.27 points
[[Site/Teams/@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)\|@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)]]'s yet-to-play:
- Puka Nacua (WR) - LAR
	- Projected: 19.64 points
[[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]]'s yet-to-play:
- Kyren Williams (RB) - LAR
	- Projected: 12.44 points

## Notes

Of the three, I'm most concerned about [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]]'s prospects. Drake London carries significant risk given his uncertain knee situation, having returned from a four-game absence last week and delivering a disappointing performance despite getting 8 targets. The upside is there: the Rams are one of the weakest defenses against WRs this season, so there's opportunity for a big game from London **if** he suits up. Vegas also has Atlanta as 7-point underdogs, meaning they're more likely to be consistently airing out the ball if they fall behind early.

Atlanta is similarly weak to WRs, so Puka is projected to have a great game: wouldn't be shocked if he gets close to or exceeds his projected total, keeping [[Site/Teams/@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)\|@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)]] very much in play as a GC contender.

Atlanta's pretty middle-of-the-pack against RBs, but as mentioned, Vegas has the Rams favored by 7 points: if the game tilts heavily in LA's favor early, Kyren is likely to get a solid share of work running the clock down.

# Footnote: The Less Glamorous Battle for 3rd Place

While there are no trophies for 3rd place (or 2nd for that matter), you do still get a little digital bronze ribbon in the trophy case on your team page for winning 3rd in the loser's bracket:

Here are the current 3rd-place matchups:

![Pasted image 20251229135128.png](/img/user/z_Assets/Pasted%20image%2020251229135128.png)

The individual matchups aren't nearly as close as the championship games going into tonight: [[Site/Teams/@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)\|@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)]] and [[Site/Teams/@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)\|@LoriH 🏆 (Jackson 5)]]–two decorated teams–have pretty securely locked up their respective matchups.

With this win, [[Site/Teams/@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)\|@OliviaH (Mrs. Fluff & Mini Mallow)]] becomes the first team to place first, second, and third in a league since I began recording stats:

Looking to be an exciting conclusion to the season: good luck to everyone still in it!
