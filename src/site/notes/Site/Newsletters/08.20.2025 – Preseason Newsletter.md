# 2025 Preseason Newsletter

Fantasy football is BACK! And with it, a completely revamped newsletter. There's a few housekeeping things to cover, and then a look at the draft, so let's jump into it‚Äìthis one's a doozy.

# Some info for rookies, or a refresher for vets

If you're new to the league and want to read a too-large document outlining pretty much everything about how the league operates, read the [[Site/Misc/PVFFL League Constitution\|PVFFL League Constitution]]. This is new to this league, but most of it I lifted from a constitution I wrote several years ago for one of my dynasty leagues.
Important bits include:
- [[Site/Misc/PVFFL League Constitution#Article III ‚Äì Playoffs\|How playoffs are seeded]]
	- [[Site/Misc/PVFFL League Constitution#Section 3 ‚Äì The League Median\|The section on the League Median is an important one]]
- [[Site/Misc/PVFFL League Constitution#Section 4 ‚Äì The Grand Championship\|How the "Grand Champion" is determined]]

I also recommend all owners take a look at the section on daily waivers, as that's something new this season that I'm introducing. Here it is embedded below:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/misc/pvffl-league-constitution/#section-2-daily-waivers" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



## Section 2 ‚Äì Daily Waivers

To keep things fair, since different owners have different schedules, PVFFL leagues use daily waivers throughout the season on the following schedule:
- Monday ‚Äì Waivers[^2]
- Tuesday ‚Äì Waivers[^2]
- Wednesday ‚Äì Waivers
- Thursday ‚Äì Waivers to Free Agency[^3]
- Friday ‚Äì Waivers
- Saturday ‚Äì Free Agency
- Sunday ‚Äì Free Agency

Waivers clear every day at 3am US/Eastern when applicable.

[^2]: Players stay on waivers after games until Wednesday at 3am.
[^3]: After waivers clear on Thursday, players go on FA to allow owners to make instant claims in time for Thursday Night Football.


> [!Question] Why?
> Midweek news/injury reports trickle in throughout the week, and owners who are more able to instantly react to news by claiming players when news breaks have a distinct advantage over owners who are less connected during the work day. Daily waivers ensures that all owners have an equal shot at claiming players that are suddenly valuable.

# New Site!

Welcome to the new home of all things PVFFL (except for what's on Sleeper and what's on https://app.pvffl.com).

> [!Help] What's https://app.pvffl.com?
> I use custom seeding for the playoffs; more specifically, the 6th seed is a wild card seed that uses your season record against the [[Site/Misc/PVFFL League Constitution#Section 3 ‚Äì The League Median\|League Median]] to determine seeding. Some leagues opt to use such a stat to seed the entire playoff lineup (each week you get 1 win for beating your opponent and 1 win for beating the league median / scoring in the top-half of the league). I want regular season matchups to matter more than that, so I only use it to seed one spot.
> Is it less fair? Yeah, probably. But it's *more* fair than if I *didn't* do it, so there.
### A new home for newsletters
I'll continue to send these newsletters in emails, but the best way to view them is going to be on the site. I'm able to embed more things and update information if I need to, and the experience is probably going to be a bit better. I'll try to keep the email quality good, though.
### Team legacies
Something I've been working on adding to our PVFFL experience is a sense of legacy. That's why I asked for the outlandish, perpetual trophy that champions get to put their and their team's names on: if you spend a ton of time and effort into drafting a strong team and keeping it competitive over a season, you ought to be rewarded with a lasting reminder of that one year you went 7-7 due to terrible luck but took a #6 seed all the way to the championships, beating your own child for the title. Shoutout to [[Site/Teams/Marshmallow Fluff (@BenH üèÜ)\|Marshmallow Fluff (@BenH üèÜ)]].

This site is an extension of that effort. If you look on the sidebar under the Teams section, you'll see a page for every person who has participated in the PVFFL since we transitioned to Sleeper. It looks like this:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/teams/marshmallow-fluff-ben-h/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">

I've written scripts to pull down all the Sleeper data the platform makes available and use it to make these tables. Here you can see with definitive proof that [[Site/Teams/Marshmallow Fluff (@BenH üèÜ)\|Marshmallow Fluff (@BenH üèÜ)]] is **THE** unluckiest owner in PVFFL history (in the Sleeper era). And on [[Site/Teams/Lights, Camera, Jackson (@LoriH üèÜ)\|Lights, Camera, Jackson (@LoriH üèÜ)]]'s page you can see that she's arguably the best owner to never secure a <mark class="yellow">Grand Champion</mark> title, being the only owner in the PVFFL to make it to the playoffs every year since 2022, winning the North league championship last year.

# Rosters are in, and the schedule is set ‚úÖ

This season, just like last season, I've manually tweaked the schedule so that Week 13 is Family Week. If you're in a league with a significant other, I've arranged the schedule so that you play that significant other for Thanksgiving. Nothing like a matchup with potential playoff implications to keep the Thanksgiving dinner conversation interesting!

# I may have unintentionally changed the roster settings from last season üòÖ

> If you didn't notice and don't care about this stuff, feel free to jump down to the next heading, lol.

Some of you from last season may have noticed a change in the roster configuration. The current season's rosters look like this:
- 1 QB
- 2 RB
- 3 WR
- 1 TE
- 2 FLEX
	- Changed from 1 FLEX last season
- 1 K
- 1 DEF
- 6 BN
	- Changed from 7 BN last season

I did not intend to change the roster settings from the last season. I grabbed the roster templates that I made two seasons ago, and the above roster config is what I had written for 10-team leagues back then.

> [!Note] Roster configs
> Each year, since we never know until the day-of what the leagues are going to look like, I come to the draft prepared with roster sheets of different configurations for different league sizes. These are the sheets you put your info on and use to track your draft picks during the draft. 
> 8-team leagues have different roster settings than 12-team leagues, and for good reason: the number of teams in the league has a large effect on the talent pool available after the draft. I try to tweak roster settings based on league size to keep things interesting/competitive.

I believe what happened was that last year, on the morning of the draft, I decided to go against my pre-written templates and go with 1 FLEX spot for 10-team leagues instead of 2, dropping a starter and deepening benches by 1. To do so, I wrote the roster setup on a blank version of my template and made copies of that instead of the pre-constructed roster sheets you guys used during the draft this year.
### What does this mean?
Well, it means more flexibility‚Äìyou can start as many as 4 RBs, 3 TEs, or 5 WRs (since we're also a 3 WR league in 10-team) if you wanted. Means more starters and hopefully fewer agonizing start/sit decisions.

I think the difference that might be felt most acutely is the 6-man bench. Slightly shallower bench + a larger set of starters should mean the waiver wire is fairly active. 6 should be enough for you to be able to hang on to sleepers and backups without teams hoarding talent, but it might mean you end up making some tough drop decisions in the middle of the season (but hopefully the two IR slots helps there).

Anyway, the main reason I'm writing all this out is to hopefully address any confusion over the change, since I didn't announce anything and it's a different roster config than we've *ever* done (since the league two seasons ago when I first wrote the roster templates was 12-team).

# Finally, a look at THE DRAFT

One of the main things these newsletters are good for in years when we have multiple leagues is keeping both leagues apprised of how the other league is going. If you make it to the championship game, the winner of the opposite league is your final hurdle to grand championship glory, so you gotta keep tabs on the competition.
To keep this short, I'm only going to highlight the strongest-looking team in each league coming out of the draft‚Äìnot going to grade every team. I'll throw some honorable mentions at the end, too.
## PVFFL North

Ben came to play and perhaps finally have a winning regular season record after a drought of at least three straight years (not that it mattered last season).

#### Notes/Takes
[[Site/Teams/Marshmallow Fluff (@BenH üèÜ)\|Marshmallow Fluff (@BenH üèÜ)]] invested where it most counts: in a strong RB and WR corps. His starting lineup is ranked first in the league at this point, with great bench depth as insurance.

His weakest/riskiest skill positions are at QB and TE, scoring 50% and 38% in consistency[^1] respectively.

While different sources rank his draft anywhere from the best to the third-best, FantasyPros' "playoff odds" tool (which projects season record based on roster strength and your strength of schedule) has him as the #1 contender in the North league. Can he be the first to secure back-to-back titles? Can he actually win more games than he loses? Only time will tell.

[^1]: Out of the past 16 games, how often a given player hit a threshold of usability for their position.

## PVFFL South

![Pasted image 20250822175144.png](/img/user/z_Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250822175144.png)

One peculiar thing I noticed when entering draft results for this league into Sleeper is that this league had a very pronounced tendency to follow trends in the draft. For example, in round 3 of the draft, 7/10 picks were QBs‚Äìpicked all one after the other. By the end of that round, 8/10 teams had drafted their starting QB.
The next round (4) was the TE round, where 6 TEs were drafted. In rounds 4 and 5, all but one team ([[Site/Teams/@trustyen\|@trustyen]]) drafted a TE. Kickers followed a similar pattern, with all but three teams picking up a kicker within rounds 9-11.
Seven teams also drafted their backup QBs within the same two rounds.

Contrasting this against the North draft board further up, the North picks for non-RB/WR positions are much more scattered, while the South board has regions of RB/WR picks demarcated by QB/DEF/TE/K pick borders, lol.
### Top Contender: [[Site/Teams/@BrianH\|@BrianH]] | Grade: A

#### Team Projections and Rankings

#### Notes/Takes

A bit weaker of an overall draft for [[Site/Teams/@BrianH\|@BrianH]] than [[Site/Teams/Marshmallow Fluff (@BenH üèÜ)\|Marshmallow Fluff (@BenH üèÜ)]] but not by much. The biggest area for improvement is at WR. It looks like Brian's going for an RB-heavy roster to fill out the flex spots, but that's come at the cost of WR talent. His three WRs are worse than most of the league, so it might be worth focusing on bolstering that position via the wire or trades early on in the season.

Of course, these draft analysts are often wrong. I was rated highly last season and didn't make the playoffs because my roster fell apart. But that's fantasy!

> [!Danger] THESE ARE PROBABLY WRONG
> Just as a healthy reminder, draft analysts are notoriously terrible at predicting things, and usually these predictions go sideways very quickly. We'll know much more about the state of things after a handful of weeks. So if you weren't highlighted above, your season and roster is not cooked (probably).

Okay, this newsletter is long enough. That's going to be all for now! I'm impatient for the season to start. Let me know if you have any questions!
