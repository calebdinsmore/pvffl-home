# PVFFL League Constitution

---
# Article I – Commissioner
## Section 1 – Responsibilities

The Commissioner of the Prairie View Fantasy Football League (“PVFFL”) is responsible for running the day-to-day operations of the PVFFL and ensuring a smooth, fair, and fun league experience.

The Commissioner also oversees trading and determines whether trades should be overturned, unless the Commissioner is party to the trade.

# Article II – Trading
## Section 1 – Trade Review

This league does not enforce a window within which to review pending trades. Owners are able to use traded players immediately upon acceptance of the trade by both parties.
## Section 2 – Vetoes/Overturning

There is no review period for pending trades, so there is no standard process of vetoing a trade prior to it taking effect.

However, there are some cases in which a trade may be overturned. The two causes for overturning a trade are as follows:

- Collusion
- Cases of extreme lopsided trades that suggest collusion

Collusion is defined as:
> The coordinated actions of two or more owners with the intention of affecting the outcome of a game, the season, or the league in some way.
> 
> An example of collusion is if one owner A had given up hope of winning the season and wanted another owner B to win. Owner A could then propose a trade offering a highly valued player in exchange for a significantly less valuable player or players.
> 
> Another example of collusion would be two owners agreeing to trade players in coordination with those players’ bye weeks with the intention to trade them back after the bye weeks had passed.

These types of trades break the spirit of the game and hurt the experience, so they will not be tolerated.

To overturn a trade, another owner in the league must put forward a motion to overturn the trade and make a case for why a trade constitutes possible collusion or is so lopsided that it would severely impact parity. A motion must be seconded by another owner before the trade can be overturned.

Once the owners involved in the trade have made a defense for why the trade should stand, the Commissioner will decide whether the trade should stand. The Commissioner may then overturn the trade or allow it to stand.

If the Commissioner is party to the trade, instead a vote may be held. If at least half of the league is in favor of overturning, the trade must be overturned.
## Section 3 – Deadline

The deadline for trading is Week 11 of the regular season. After this point trading is locked and teams may only augment rosters via the waiver wire.

# Article III – Playoffs
## Section 1 – Seeding for 10- and 12-team Leagues

12-team leagues implement a six-team Championship playoff bracket. The top six teams will be decided as follows:

- 1st Seed-5th Seed: Top-five teams by regular season record, with ties broken using Points-For.
- 6th Seed: Wild card. Best record against the League Median[^1] among remaining teams

Record ties will be broken by points-scored over the regular season.

[^1]: League Median is defined in Section 3 of this Article.
## Section 2 – Seeding for 8-team Leagues

8-team leagues implement a four-team playoff bracket, decided as follows:
- 1st Seed-3rd Seed: Top-three teams by regular season record, with ties broken using Points-For.
- 4th Seed: Wild card. Best record against the League Median among remaining teams
## Section 3 – The League Median

**Definition:** 
> The League Median is calculated by taking the average of the middle two teams’ scores for a given week. For example, if in one week (in a 12-team league) the 6th highest-scoring team scored 200 points and the 7th highest-scoring team scored 100 points, the League Median for that week would be 150.

During the regular season, each team’s score will be compared to the League Median in an “extra matchup” of sorts, and the Commissioner will be responsible for recording and publishing those results. In this league, those results are tracked automatically at https://app.pvffl.com.

At the end of the season, the LM seed will be determined by ranking unseeded teams by this set of tie-breaker criteria and selecting the winner:

- Wins against the League Median
- Points For
- Coin flip
## Section 4 – The Grand Championship

![ChampTrophy128.png|center](/img/user/z_Assets/img/ChampTrophy128.png)

The PVFFL has a single perpetual championship trophy, awarded each season to the Grand Champion.

In seasons where the PVFFL runs only a single league, the Grand Champion is the owner who wins the championship game in the postseason.

In seasons where the PVFFL runs more than one league, the Grand Champion is the owner who (1) wins the championship game in the postseason for their league, and (2) scores the most points among league champions.

All league champions receive a trophy, but only the Grand Champion gets their name on the PVFFL trophy.

# Article IV – The Draft

## Section 1 – Determination

As this is a redraft league, draft order each year is determined randomly by drawing from a cup.
## Section 2 – Procedure

Drafts are done in person as a snake draft.

---
# Article V – Waivers 

## Section 1 – Waiver Type

This league uses rolling waivers for selecting players off of the waiver wire. That is, the last owner to place a waiver claim is placed last in waiver priority.
## Section 2 – Daily Waivers

To keep things fair, since different owners have different schedules, PVFFL leagues use daily waivers throughout the season on the following schedule:
- Monday – Waivers[^2]
- Tuesday – Waivers[^2]
- Wednesday – Waivers
- Thursday – Waivers to Free Agency[^3]
- Friday – Waivers
- Saturday – Free Agency
- Sunday – Free Agency

Waivers clear every day at 3am US/Eastern when applicable.

[^2]: Players stay on waivers after games until Wednesday at 3am.
[^3]: After waivers clear on Thursday, players go on FA to allow owners to make instant claims in time for Thursday Night Football.


> [!Question] Why?
> Midweek news/injury reports trickle in throughout the week, and owners who are more able to instantly react to news by claiming players when news breaks have a distinct advantage over owners who are less connected during the work day. Daily waivers ensures that all owners have an equal shot at claiming players that are suddenly valuable.
