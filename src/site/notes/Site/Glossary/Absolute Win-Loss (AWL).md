This is the win/loss record you would have if you played every other team every week.

So for example:
- If you were the top scorer in week 1 in a league with 10 teams, you would have beaten every other team. That would make your absolute win/loss record 9-0.
- If you were the second-highest scorer in week 2, your AWL for that week would be 8-1. Your AWL for the season up to that point would then be 17-1.
