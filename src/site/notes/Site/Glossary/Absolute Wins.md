This is the number of wins you would have for a given time period (e.g. a week) if you played every other team in the league (or in some cases, multiple leagues).

So, for example, if you were the top scorer in a 10-team league for a given week, that would give you 9 absolute wins for that week, since you would have beaten every one of the other teams.
