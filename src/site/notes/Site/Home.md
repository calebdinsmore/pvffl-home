# Week 15 Newsletter: Playoffs are Set

Well, that was a pretty tense MNF game for the North league. Everything came down to the second-to-last play of overtime: if Dallas Goedert didn't catch that pass, I would have made it into the playoffs and [[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] would have been locked out. Crazy week!

> Moment of shame for [[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]], the only playoff-bound team who hasn't set a proper team name.

# Live League Median App

If you're not familiar, the primary function of this app is so league members can see the league median in real-time (as it has bearing on the [[Site/Misc/PVFFL League Constitution#Section 3 – The League Median\|wild card playoff seed]]). It also automatically calculates current playoff seeding–but not as a forecast tool; it merely says who would get which seed *if the playoffs were seeded today.*
