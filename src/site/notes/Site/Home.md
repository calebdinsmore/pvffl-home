# 2025 Week 5 Newsletter

> [!warning] BYE Week are Upon Us!
> 
> Fix your lineups! In my dynasty league I manually fix lineups to make sure everyone's fielding a legal starting lineup, and if I do it more than once the team suffers penalties to their draft position the following year. Best weapon I have in this league is shame, so I *will* shame you if I have to do it.

Well, September went by quick. ðŸ˜… Been a busy past month for me, so I've not gotten around to writing a newsletter until now. Part of it is that my tools and special spreadsheet I've been using to analyze stats and make the tables I put in the newsletters got a bit buggy after some changes to Sleeper's API.

However, I've spent some time working on scripts to automate everything and even expand on the stats and tables I've put in these newsletters, meaning newsletters should take less time and I'll be able to write more of them!

# Live League Median App

If you're not familiar, the primary function of this app is so league members can see the league median in real-time (as it has bearing on the [[Site/Misc/PVFFL League Constitution#Section 3 â€“ The League Median\|wild card playoff seed]]). It also automatically calculates current playoff seedingâ€“but not as a forecast tool; it merely says who would get which seed *if the playoffs were seeded today.*
