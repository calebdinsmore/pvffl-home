# Championship Week Newsletter

Good evening, PVFFL! Holiday craziness has kept me from writing up another newsletter since the last, but I wanted to get a super quick one out as we're on the eve of figuring out who the next <mark class="yellow">PVFFL Grand Champion</mark> will be, and right now it's looking really close.

## The PVFFL North Finalists

[[Site/Teams/@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)\|@BenH 🏆 (Marshmallow Fluff)]] and [[Site/Teams/@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)\|@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)]] are locked in a potentially very high-scoring matchup, with projections that are functionally equal. More of [[Site/Teams/@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)\|@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)]]'s points are already secured, though–more risk at this point of Ben's team falling apart in the remaining games.

[[Site/Teams/@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)\|@cardkid2331 (Super Lamar-io)]]'s only player left to play (Monday night) is Puka Nacua, who scored 40 points last week. Soooo
## The PVFFL South Finalists

At this point, [[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]] is looking like the newest PVFFL South champ. I wouldn't completely rule out [[Site/Teams/@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)\|@cpence0712 (Gibbsmethetrophy)]], though–her remaining players are Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua: an absolutely frightening QB/WR stack.

[[Site/Teams/@OneTrustyGuy\|@OneTrustyGuy]] is also in the very tight race for Grand Champion, projected to land within 5 points of the PVFFL North contenders at the time of writing.

Everyone in these championships (save for Ben) is going to end up with their best finish in the PVFFL (in the Sleeper era) no matter what happens. Ben is looking to get the first back-to-back championship, which is pretty insane, especially considering the terrible luck he's dealt with over multiple seasons.

Anyway, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, PVFFL! Looking forward to seeing who takes the crown tomorrow.

# Live League Median App

If you're not familiar, the primary function of this app is so league members can see the league median in real-time (as it has bearing on the [[Site/Misc/PVFFL League Constitution#Section 3 – The League Median\|wild card playoff seed]]). It also automatically calculates current playoff seeding–but not as a forecast tool; it merely says who would get which seed *if the playoffs were seeded today.*
