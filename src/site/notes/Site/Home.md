# 2025 Preseason Newsletter

Fantasy football is BACK! And with it, a completely revamped newsletter. There's a few housekeeping things to cover, and then a look at the draft, so let's jump into it.
## New Site!

Welcome to the new home of all things PVFFL (except for what's on Sleeper and what's on https://app.pvffl.com).
#### A new home for newsletters
I'll continue to send these newsletters in emails, but the best way to view them is going to be on the site. I'm able to embed more things and update information if I need to, and the experience is probably going to be a bit better. I'll try to keep the email quality good, though.
#### Team legacies
Something I've been working on adding to our PVFFL experience is a sense of legacy. That's why I asked for the outlandish, perpetual trophy that champions get to put their and their team's names on: if you spend a ton of time and effort into drafting a strong team and keeping it competitive over a season, you ought to be rewarded with a lasting reminder of that one year you went 7-7 due to terrible luck but took a #6 seed all the way to the championships, beating your own child for the title. Shoutout to [[Site/Teams/@BenH üèÜ\|@BenH üèÜ]].

This site is an extension of that effort. If you look on the sidebar under the Teams section, you'll see a page for every person who has participated in the PVFFL since we transitioned to Sleeper. It looks like this:

I've written scripts to pull down all the Sleeper data the platform makes available and use it to make these tables. Here you can see with definitive proof that [[Site/Teams/@BenH üèÜ\|@BenH üèÜ]] is **THE** unluckiest owner in PVFFL history (in the Sleeper era). And on [[Site/Teams/@LoriH üèÜ\|@LoriH üèÜ]]'s page you can see that she's arguably the best owner to never secure a <mark class="yellow">Grand Champion</mark> title, being the only owner in the PVFFL to make it to the playoffs every year since 2022.
## I may have accidentally changed the roster settings from last season üòÖ

> If you didn't notice and don't care about this stuff, feel free to jump down to the next heading, lol.

Some of you from last season may have noticed a change in the roster configuration. The current season's rosters look like this:
- 1 QB
- 2 RB
- 3 WR
- 1 TE
- 2 FLEX
	- Changed from 1 FLEX last season
- 1 K
- 1 DEF
- 6 BN
	- Changed from 7 BN last season

I did not intend to change the roster settings from the last season. I grabbed the roster templates that I made two seasons ago, and the above roster config is what I had written for 10-team leagues two seasons ago.

> [!Roster configs] 
> Each year, since we never know until the day-of what the leagues are going to look like, I come to the draft prepared with roster sheets of different configurations for different league sizes. These are the sheets you put your info on and use to track your draft picks during the draft. 
> 8-team leagues have different roster settings than 12-team leagues, and for good reason: the number of teams in the league has a large effect on the talent pool available after the draft. I try to tweak roster settings based on league size to keep things interesting/competitive.

I believe what happened was that last year, on the morning of the draft, I decided to go against my written templates and go with 1 FLEX spot for 10-team leagues instead of 2, dropping a starter and deepening benches by 1. To do so, I wrote the roster setup on a blank version of my template and made copies of that instead of the pre-constructed roster sheets you guys used during the draft this year.
### What does this mean?
Well, it means more flexibility‚Äìyou can start as many as 4 RBs or 5 WRs (since we're also a 3 WR league in 10-team) if you wanted. Means more starters and hopefully fewer agonizing start/sit decisions.

I think the difference that might be felt most acutely is the 6-man bench. Slightly shallower bench + a larger set of starters should mean the waiver wire is fairly active. 6 should be enough for you to be able to hang on to sleepers and backups without teams hoarding talent, but it might mean you end up making some tough drop decisions in the middle of the season (but hopefully the two IR slots helps there).

Anyway, the main reason I'm writing all this out is to hopefully address any confusion over the change, since I didn't announce anything and it's a different roster config than we've *ever* done (since the league two seasons ago when I first wrote the roster templates was 12-team).
